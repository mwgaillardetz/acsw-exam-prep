                topic: "Erikson's Psychosocial Development Theory",
                details: "Eight stages of psychosocial development from infancy to late adulthood. Each stage presents a crisis that must be resolved: Trust vs. Mistrust (infancy), Autonomy vs. Shame (early childhood), Initiative vs. Guilt (preschool), Industry vs. Inferiority (school age), Identity vs. Role Confusion (adolescence), Intimacy vs. Isolation (young adulthood), Generativity vs. Stagnation (middle adulthood), Integrity vs. Despair (late adulthood). Understanding these stages helps assess developmental challenges and strengths."

                topic: "Piaget's Cognitive Development Theory",

Key concepts include assimilation, accommodation, and equilibration."
