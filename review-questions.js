                question: "A social worker is assessing a 15-year-old client who states, \"I don't fit in anywhere, and I'm not sure who I'm supposed to be.\" According to Erik Erikson's stages of psychosocial development, which stage is the client MOST likely struggling with?",
                options: [
                    "Industry vs. Inferiority",
                    "Identity vs. Role Confusion",
                    "Intimacy vs. Isolation",
                    "Generativity vs. Stagnation"
                ],
                correctAnswer: 1,
                explanation: "Erikson's Identity vs. Role Confusion stage is typical for adolescents (ages 12-18), where the main task is to develop a sense of self and personal identity. The client's statements directly reflect struggles with self-identity and belonging. Other stages like Industry vs. Inferiority (school-age competence), Intimacy vs. Isolation (young adult relationships), and Generativity vs. Stagnation (middle adulthood contribution) are different developmental stages."

                question: "A social worker is working with a family recently arrived from a war-torn country. The family expresses deep gratitude for basic needs like shelter and food, and seems less concerned with immediate long-term psychological counseling. Using Maslow's hierarchy of needs, which of the following is the MOST appropriate initial focus for the social worker?",
                options: [
                    "Helping family members process their trauma.",
                    "Referring them to job training programs for self-actualization.",
                    "Ensuring their continued access to stable housing and food.",
                    "Exploring their social and emotional needs for community integration."
                ],
                correctAnswer: 2,
                explanation: "Maslow's hierarchy states that basic physiological (food, water, shelter) and safety needs must be met before higher-level psychological or self-actualization needs can be addressed. The family's immediate gratitude for basic needs signifies these are their priority. Processing trauma, job training, and community integration are important but come after physiological and safety needs are secured."

            {
                question: "A social worker notes that a client's verbal statements of happiness do not match their slumped posture and downcast eyes. What concept is the social worker observing?",
                options: [
                    "Resistance",
                    "Transference",
                    "Lack of congruence",
                    "Latent content"
                ],
                correctAnswer: 2,
                explanation: "Congruence refers to the matching of awareness and experience with communication, meaning verbal and nonverbal expressions are consistent. When a client's words ('I'm fine') contradict their nonverbal cues (slumped posture, low voice), it indicates a lack of congruence. Resistance is a broader concept but doesn't specifically describe this mismatch. Transference involves projecting past feelings onto the social worker. Latent content is the underlying meaning, which is what the social worker is trying to understand because of the lack of congruence, but it's not the phenomenon itself."

        questions: [
            {
                question: "A social worker is conducting an intake assessment. Which of the following pieces of information would be categorized under the \"Biological\" section of a biopsychosocial assessment?",
                options: [
                    "Client's current coping mechanisms for stress.",
                    "Family history of medical illnesses.",
                    "Client's spiritual practices.",
                    "Client's employment history."
                ],
                correctAnswer: 1,
                explanation: "The biological section of a biopsychosocial assessment specifically includes a client's medical history, developmental history, current medications, substance abuse history, and family history of medical illnesses. Coping mechanisms are psychological. Spiritual practices are spiritual/cultural. Employment history is social/vocational."
            },
            {
                question: "A social worker observes that a client consistently answers questions related to anxiety symptoms in the same way across different assessment tools used during intake. This suggests that the assessment tools have high:",
                options: [
                    "External validity",
                    "Internal consistency reliability",
                    "Criterion-related validity",
                    "Content validity"
                ],
                correctAnswer: 1,
                explanation: "Internal consistency reliability assesses the consistency of results across items within a test, or in this case, across different assessment tools that measure the same construct (anxiety symptoms). If a client consistently responds similarly on multiple measures for anxiety, those measures have good internal consistency. External validity refers to generalizability. Criterion-related validity examines how well a measure correlates with an external criterion. Content validity ensures all relevant domains are covered."
            },
            {
                question: "During an assessment, a social worker asks a client, \"What are some of the reasons you've found it difficult to attend therapy regularly?\" This phrasing is preferred over \"Why haven't you been coming to therapy?\" primarily because it:",
                options: [
                    "Seeks to validate the client's resistance.",
                    "Avoids making the client feel judged or defensive.",
                    "Focuses on the client's past behaviors rather than current ones.",
                    "Limits the scope of information to be gathered."
                ],
                correctAnswer: 1,
                explanation: "The sources recommend avoiding \"Why\" questions (e.g., \"Why haven't you...\") because they can make clients feel defensive or that they need to justify their actions. Phrasing with \"What are some of the reasons...\" allows for more reflection without judgment, promoting open communication."

        questions: [
            {
                question: "A social worker working with an involuntary client spends the initial session focusing on explaining the agency's purpose, outlining what services the client has control over, and clarifying the potential consequences of non-participation. Which phase of the problem-solving process is the social worker primarily engaged in?",
                options: [
                    "Assessment",
                    "Planning",
                    "Engagement",
                    "Intervention"
                ],
                correctAnswer: 2,
                explanation: "The engagement phase is when the social worker establishes rapport, clarifies the purpose of services, defines roles, and manages expectations, especially crucial with involuntary clients who may feel forced into treatment. Explaining what the client has control over and likely consequences directly facilitates engagement with a mandated client. Assessment (information gathering), planning (goal setting), and intervention (active strategies) occur after engagement."
            },
            {
                question: "A social worker observes a client who frequently says, \"I'm fine,\" but constantly fidgets, avoids eye contact, and speaks in a low, strained voice. The social worker addresses this discrepancy by saying, \"You're telling me everything is okay, but your body language suggests you're feeling a lot of tension.\" Which interviewing technique is the social worker using?",
                options: [
                    "Clarification",
                    "Summarization",
                    "Confrontation",
                    "Universalization"
                ],
                correctAnswer: 2,
                explanation: "Confrontation as an interviewing technique involves calling attention to something, particularly discrepancies or inconsistencies in the client's communication. The social worker is pointing out the mismatch between the client's verbal and nonverbal messages. Clarification reformulates problems. Summarization identifies key ideas. Universalization normalizes behavior. These do not directly address the discrepancy between verbal and non-verbal cues."
            },
            {
                question: "A social worker encourages a client with severe anxiety to keep a daily log of situations that trigger anxiety, the exact behaviors engaged in during those moments, and any thoughts that emerge. This technique is a core component of which therapeutic approach?",
                options: [
                    "Psychoanalytic therapy",
                    "Narrative therapy",
                    "Cognitive behavioral therapy",
                    "Existential therapy"
                ],
                correctAnswer: 2,
                explanation: "Client self-monitoring, often through keeping \"thought or emotion logs\" that include disturbing emotional states, behaviors, and thoughts, is a central and foundational element of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT). This homework helps clients identify patterns and connect thoughts to feelings and behaviors. While other therapies might use journaling, self-monitoring of this specific nature is a hallmark of CBT for understanding and changing thinking patterns."

        questions: [
            {
                question: "A social worker receives a subpoena for a client's records. What should the social worker's FIRST action be?",
                options: [
                    "Immediately send the records to the requesting attorney.",
                    "Contact the client to discuss authorization to release the information.",
                    "Claim privilege and await a court order.",
                    "Consult with the agency's legal department."
                ],
                correctAnswer: 2,
                explanation: "A subpoena is a request for information, but it is not a court order. Social workers have a duty to protect client confidentiality and should claim privilege (the client's right to prevent confidential information from being used in legal proceedings) and wait for a court order signed by a judge before releasing information without client consent, unless there's an imminent threat of harm. Sending records immediately would breach confidentiality. Contacting the client is important after the initial legal duty is understood. Consulting legal is good, but the first direct action regarding the subpoena itself is to claim privilege."

            {
                question: "A social worker is providing services to a client who reports severe physical pain due to a chronic illness, alongside feelings of deep sadness and hopelessness. Following Maslow's hierarchy of needs, what should the social worker prioritize in their initial intervention?",
                options: [
                    "Addressing the client's feelings of hopelessness through counseling.",
                    "Connecting the client with resources for pain management and medical care.",
                    "Exploring the client's social isolation and lack of support.",
                    "Developing long-term goals for improving the client's quality of life."
                ],
                correctAnswer: 1,
                explanation: "According to Maslow's hierarchy of needs, physiological and safety needs are foundational. Severe physical pain and chronic illness directly relate to physiological well-being, which must be addressed before or concurrently with psychological distress or social needs. While important, addressing hopelessness, social isolation, and long-term goals are higher-level needs that are difficult to focus on effectively if basic physical well-being is severely compromised."

                question: "A social worker learns that her new client is the sibling of a former client she terminated services with several years ago. The previous termination was positive and without unresolved issues. To proceed ethically, the social worker should FIRST:",
                options: [
                    "Inform both clients about the potential dual relationship and seek their consent to continue.",
                    "Decline to provide services to the new client due to the inherent conflict of interest.",
                    "Assess if the current client's issues are distinct enough to prevent a conflict.",
                    "Ensure clear boundaries are established and maintained with the new client."
                ],
                correctAnswer: 0,
                explanation: "Social workers should be alert to and avoid conflicts of interest, and when a potential conflict arises, they must inform clients and take reasonable steps to resolve the issue in a manner that makes clients' interests primary. Even if the prior relationship was positive, transparency and client consent are crucial to maintaining ethical boundaries and ensuring the client's self-determination is respected. Declining services immediately might not be necessary if transparency and consent can resolve the issue. Assessing distinctness of issues is part of the overall ethical deliberation, but informing and consenting are the first steps in addressing the potential conflict directly with clients. Establishing boundaries is always important but needs to follow transparent disclosure."

                question: "A social worker working in a community mental health clinic notices a pattern of high client no-show rates for initial appointments. To address this, the social worker decides to implement a pre-intake phone call where the purpose of services, expectations, and the problem-solving process are clearly explained. This intervention primarily targets which stage of change?",
                options: [
                    "Contemplation",
                    "Preparation",
                    "Action",
                    "Precontemplation"
                ],
                correctAnswer: 3,
                explanation: "In the precontemplation stage, clients are unaware, unable, or unwilling to change, often characterized by lack of motivation and high resistance. The \"no-show\" rate indicates a lack of engagement or perceived need for services. The pre-intake call aims to establish rapport, acknowledge potential ambivalence, and provide clarity, which are strategies for working with clients in precontemplation. Contemplation (considering change), Preparation (deciding/preparing), and Action (actively changing) occur later in the change process once a client acknowledges the problem and expresses some desire to address it."

                question: "A social worker wants to evaluate if a new group therapy curriculum effectively reduces anxiety symptoms in adolescents. The social worker randomly assigns students to either the new curriculum group or a control group that receives standard care. Anxiety levels are measured before and after the intervention. This type of research design is BEST described as:",
                options: [
                    "Single-subject",
                    "Quasi-experimental",
                    "Experimental",
                    "Qualitative"
                ],
                correctAnswer: 2,
                explanation: "An experimental design is characterized by random assignment to treatment and control groups and measurement before and after intervention, allowing for strong conclusions about cause-effect relationships (internal validity). Single-subject designs focus on one individual. Quasi-experimental designs lack random assignment. Qualitative research explores experiences and meanings, not necessarily cause-effect."
