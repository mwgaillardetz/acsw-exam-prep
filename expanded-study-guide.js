                details: "Four stages: Sensorimotor (0-2 years) - learning through senses, object permanence develops; Preoperational (2-7 years) - symbolic thinking, egocentrism, animism; Concrete Operational (7-11 years) - logical thinking about concrete objects, conservation; Formal Operational (11+ years) - abstract thinking, hypothetical reasoning. Key processes: assimilation (fitting new info into existing schemas), accommodation (changing schemas), equilibration (balance between assimilation/accommodation)."

Ainsworth's attachment styles: Secure (60%) - distressed when separated, easily comforted; Anxious-Resistant (15%) - clingy, difficult to comfort; Avoidant (20%) - little distress at separation; Disorganized (5%) - inconsistent behaviors.
